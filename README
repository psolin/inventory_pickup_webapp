#Django Inventory Pickup Web App
Created to help keep track of sold/held customer merchandise.


##General concepts
Customers make a sale, which are referred to as transactions.  Transactions have items.  These items are held by a store, and need to be tracked.


##How to use
Install Django 2.0+.

Download and `cd` into the repository.

Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations`, then `python manage.py migrate`.

Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser --username=YOUR_USERNAME --email=YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

In settings.py, change the time zone (if necessary) and secret key.

`python manage.py runserver` to start the development server.

Create/manage users through the admin.
